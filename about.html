				<!-- Work Experience -->
				<h2>Work Experience</h2>
				<p>During my 14-month tenure as an Advanced Application Engineering Analyst at Accenture, I gained invaluable experience working 
					extensively with the Elastic Stack and Database Management Systems (DBMS). My role involved leveraging the power of 
					Elastic Stack for various projects, including data indexing, search, and analytics. I became proficient in utilizing 
					Elasticsearch for real-time data analysis and visualization, Logstash for data processing, and Kibana for dashboard creation
					 and monitoring. Additionally, I had the opportunity to work with both MongoDB and SQL databases, handling tasks such as 
					 data modeling, querying, and performance optimization. This hands-on experience allowed me to develop a deep understanding 
					 of data management principles and enhanced my problem-solving skills in complex, real-world scenarios.
				</p>

				<!-- Degrees -->
				<h2>Degrees</h2>
				<p>I hold a Bachelor of Technology degree from Vellore Institute of Technology, with coursework encompassing essential 
					subjects such as Fundamentals of Machine Learning, Fundamentals of Data Analytics, Essentials and Advanced Data Analytics, 
					Artificial Intelligence, Python programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Object-Oriented Programming.
				</p>

				<!-- Volunteer Experiences -->
				<h2>Volunteer Experiences and Passion for Data Science</h2>
				<p> I dedicated two enriching years to U & I, an esteemed NGO based in Bangalore and Chennai. Here, I committed six hours each week
					to teaching children from orphanages foundational subjects like Mathematics and English. Using innovative methods involving
					charts and cartoons, I strived to make learning engaging and accessible. This experience ignited my passion for data 
					science, as I leveraged creative tools to enhance educational outcomes. Additionally, I spearheaded initiatives to raise 
					funds for education and essential resources, supporting families in need, especially during the challenging times of the
					COVID-19 pandemic.

					At VITEACH, VIT Chennai, I had the privilege of serving as the Department Head for one year, following two years as an active 
					member. Leading a dedicated team, we undertook daily teaching missions in neighboring schools, covering subjects like 
					Mathematics, Science, and Computer Science. Throughout the academic year, I coordinated efforts to procure and distribute 
					stationery, textbooks, and notebooks, ensuring students had the tools they needed to excel. Our engagement extended beyond 
					the classroom; we organized events during festivals and conducted campus tours at VIT Chennai to inspire a culture of regular 
					study habits among students. This multifaceted experience significantly honed my skills in data management, team leadership, 
					and community engagement.

					These volunteer roles exemplify my unwavering commitment to diversity, education, and the transformative power of 
					data-driven approaches. They have not only enriched the lives of those I've had the privilege to serve but have also shaped my 
					trajectory towards a career in data science, where I continue to apply these invaluable skills and insights.</p>
